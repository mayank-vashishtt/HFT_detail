pub sub vs pooling ? 
what is NIC ? 
wht pub sub is faster than this ? 
NIC to Rx Ring?  nic have its own rx ring 
diff between load and store? 
what payload have -- IP, destination address , source address , protocol type (TCP/UDP) , port no , data, check sum 
rx ring buffer belong only to hardware , it never can be swapped 
to store something on ram we run .store , CPU run this 
how the hell NIC do it, it's not a CPU ? -- DMA (direct memory access) 
DMA can write without contacting to CPU , its faster as CPU involvement is not there
DMA controller have its own bus to write on main memory
nic driver tell to kernel where the rx ring buffer is located in main memory
when packet arrive nic write to that location using DMA
process p1 is waiting for data from network
so when data arrive nic write to main memory using DMA
now how process p1 get notified that data is there ?    

kernel have to read ring buffer and do check sum 
socket object in kernal copy all bytes in nic buffer only payload
process p1 which was on port 3000 now kernel socket in on 3000 
from socket it will copy to my process p1 
now from process p1 u can pass a msg 



kernel paijing ? 
kernel bypass ? dont do copy in socket of kernal bypass it 





nic recieved bytes 
dna we write to nic buffer
nic driver read from buffer
there is pub sub thing 
kernal knows some new bits are there 
so it notifies the app


driver is a program that sits above a hardware. 



process, i


what is boost lib ? 

boost 
using namespace boost::asio::ip; 

lamda functions ? 


file descriptors ?
