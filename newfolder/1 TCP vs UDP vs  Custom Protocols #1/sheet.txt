custom protocol 

network ? 

what is NIC ? 
system clock ? 
synornization of clocks ?
sync the clock through ethernet  --- it have 2 wire one for signal with for syncing 
manchester coding. -- -one way to sync coding 
NRZ coding -- another way to sync coding



in HFT you will not use ethernet much 
optical fiber -- you will use this more in HFT

router -- send microwave signals, sending a wave from one antenna to another antenna
amplify the signal with same frequency
similary with antetnna binary data is sent

framing -- ?
adding some extra bits to identify start and end of data , delimiter
HDLC framing -- high level data link control framing -- adding flag bits at start and end of data 
ethernet framing -- adding preamble , start frame delimiter , mac address , ethertype , frame check sequence

local networks --- 
if u wanna send to one local connected machine to another 
u will use mac address -- it's 6 byte address 
it bounds to NIC 


u can't know mac address of ec2 instance 

what is IP -- 32 bits 

below the oceans are IP lines ? 


what is subnet mask ? 

assumption : router always have suffix 1  and prefix ? 


data sending through IP ? 


subnet and IP relation ? 
subnet is a part of IP address 
subnet mask is used to identify subnet part and host part of IP address

first 20 bits will be common for all machines in same router 
if i want to send somehting to all machines in same subnet i can use broadcast address
broadcast address -- all bits of host part are 1


route table ? 
how router know where to send packet ?
each router have a route table 
route table have entries like
destination address , subnet mask , next hop address , interface
example -- 


lookup ip adress present in local route table  --- to send something outta local network
