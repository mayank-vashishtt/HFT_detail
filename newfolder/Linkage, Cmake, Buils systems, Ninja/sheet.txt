last session -- recap 

protocols , tcp , udp 
why udp is faster than tcp?
1. No Connection Establishment
TCP requires a 3-way handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK) to establish a connection before data transfer
UDP sends data immediately without any connection setup overhead
2. No Acknowledgment
TCP requires the receiver to acknowledge every packet received
UDP has no acknowledgment mechanism, reducing round-trip overhead

we discussed tcp in depth 
mac address?

how to use lib in c++ ? 


host your algo in same region where infra exist thats co location (millisecond level)


binance infra --
matching engine is always centralized 
load balancer routes to(like if req coming from india i will route to pod 1 there internal logic)
-- api gateway(multiple:) -- 
-- diff microservices (like position service, read service) -- 


pod physical location -- as low latency dev 
hot shark in system design ?
hot swap -- ability to replace components without downtime

hot spot problem ? -- 
when multiple req come to same db or same server at same time

what is shad in binance? -- shadow copy of order book

http is faster than https 

ioc gtc cancel orders type ? 

ws arbitage --- 


ws::bybit.com/getorders -- steps to hit this endpoint 
DNS Lookup → TCP Connection → TLS Handshake → WebSocket Upgrade → Bidirectional Communication
if this is internal endpoint 
ws::bybit.com -- global DNS
/getorders --- loadbalancer
go to DNS(wait to 5ms to get IP address)-- get IP address -- connect to this protocol
when lost DNS again  have to reestablilish -- then go to kernel - context switch -- to see that in cache(wasted 500ms)

l1 l2 l3 got empty then have to fetch from main memory waste a lot time
in-memory cache is ANSWER but if IP changes 
run back ground thread and check for ip change in every 5 min and update in cache

todo -- how we can offload SSL from CPU ? 

ws  --- SBE ; will prefer this as its not giving json 
http -- REST

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
what logger.h 
.h means ? i did defination there 
and implmentation in .cpp

what is linking in c++ ? 

less logger.h


ls - lrth 
makefile also do this 
makefile


cmake -- 
CMakeLists.txt


boost lib in c++ ? 
google.test lib is also there
google benchwork
