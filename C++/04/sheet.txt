This image illustrates a concept in C++ related to pointers and function arguments. Here's the breakdown:

Code Explanation:
Function f:

void f(int* ptrToX) {
    ptrToX = nullptr;
}


The function f takes a pointer to an integer (int* ptrToX) as its argument.
Inside the function, the pointer ptrToX is set to nullptr. This means the pointer no longer points to any valid memory addres


Main Function:

int main() {
    int x = 12;
    f(&x);
    cout << x; // Outputs: 12
}


A variable x is initialized with the value 12.
The address of x (&x) is passed to the function f.
After the function call, the value of x remains unchanged (12), as the function only modifies the local copy of the pointer, not the actual value of x.
Key Concept:
Pointer Modification:
When a pointer is passed to a function, the function receives a copy of the pointer (not the original pointer itself).
Modifying the pointer inside the function (e.g., setting it to nullptr) does not affect the original pointer or the value it points to.


Diagram Explanation:
The diagram visually represents the memory and pointer behavior:
ptrToX initially points to the memory address of x (value 12).
Inside the function, ptrToX is set to nullptr, breaking the connection to x.
However, the value of x remains unchanged (12) because the function does not directly modify the value stored at the memory address.
Output:


The cout << x; statement in the main function outputs 12, confirming that the value of x was not altered by the function f.


wht is heap and stack in c++
new / malloc -- heap 


matrix 
pointers to array of pointers(array of pointers) -- 


write code for it 
m pointers n rzise


int ** x


heap based array ? 
stack based bases array ? 


make a transpose fo arry ?

declare a linkedin list in c+++ and connect 4-5 nodes 
print head and whole linked list



#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

struct Node {
    int data;
    Node* next;
};

Node* makeLL() {
    Node* head = new Node{10, nullptr}; // Create head node
    Node* next = new Node{11, nullptr}; // Create next node
    head->next = next;                 // Connect head to next
    return head;
}

int main() {
    Node* head = makeLL(); // Create the linked list
    Node* temp = head;     // Temporary pointer to traverse the list

    while (temp != nullptr) {
        cout << temp->data << " -> "; // Print the data of the current node
        temp = temp->next;           // Move to the next node
    }
    cout << "nullptr" << endl;

    // Free allocated memory
    delete head->next;
    delete head;

    return 0;
}



why segmentation fault ? 

dangling pointer?

what is ddestrutore? and use it in node linkedlist


stack overflow ? 

context switch ?
stack heap which is faster? and why ?
heap memory ? 



nrvo -- 
rvo -- return value optimization 


system calls kernel calls?
pages?


grep command ? 
Which sys call gets used for larger memory allocs ?

what happens if we use '\n'?
