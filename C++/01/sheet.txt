defining hft?

arbitrage? 


what is order book ? 

bids and asks ? 

matching engine ? 

wht is NIFTY ? 

what is nse and bse and how same stock traded in both ? 


what is fill in mkt ? 


wht hft to do with c++ and latency ? 

mkt data ? -- bids and ask 


what are sockets ? 


what NIC is ?



socket connects to the port ? 


every milli sec mkt data changes ?



write a dummy socket class 
you have to read a data from java web socket and parse string and do million of this operation

how much time java will take to run it ? 

wht is bash shell script 


g++ name.cpp -o outut
./outut

 
g++ name.cpp -S

why java in bad in latency ? 
running in jvm of java creates another layer, do that create latency. ?
garabage collector is the reason ?  has a context switch and unpredicatable that makes it slow 
all objects are in heap 
way it allocates memory
object oriented? it makes it slow tooo , 


What is FPGA in HFT?
and how its the easiest way to go in HFT



garbage collector --- atuomatic memory management
how java performe garbage collection
mark sweep 
ref counting

has a context switch and unpredicatable that makes it slow 



threads in java


multi threading jn java?


daemon thread? 



c++ dont haave grabage collector?


super in java? 


how java called first super constructor before calling student()
calling super parent makes it slow 


c++ when compile it it generates assembly instruction
java compiled to java byte code
java is platform independent -- jvm should be supported 
jvm is os dependent 
c++ is platform dependent
java. --> bytecode ---> JVM 
c++ is direcly interacting with CPU 

thats why c++ is faster


vim cat 



when both import have function how to distintguish in java?
