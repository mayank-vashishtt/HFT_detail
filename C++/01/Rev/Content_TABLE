Defining HFT
Arbitrage
What is Order Book?
Bids and Asks
Matching engine (how orders get filled and executed)
What is NIFTY?
What is NSE and BSE & how is the same stock traded on both?
What is “fill” in the market?
HFT, C++ and latency (connection explained technically)
Market data: bids and asks in practical feeds
What are sockets?
What is NIC?
Socket connections to ports
Market data frequency (update every millisecond)
Dummy socket class, parsing string/million operations example
How much time Java would take for such parsing
What is bash shell script?
C++ compile/run/generate assembly commands (g++)
Why Java is slow in latency (JVM, garbage collector, etc.)
FPGA in HFT (and why it’s preferred)
Java garbage collector: how it works (mark sweep, ref counting)
Context switches and unpredictable latency in Java
Threads/multi-threading in Java
Daemon thread in Java
C++ doesn’t have garbage collector — implications
super in Java (constructors, inheritance)
Java vs C++ compilation (native vs JVM, platform independence)
Vim, cat (quick reference)
Java import collision (if two imports have the same function, how to distinguish)
