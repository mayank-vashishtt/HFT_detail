Bids and Asks – Deep Dive

Bids and asks are the core data in every order book:
Bid: The highest price a buyer is willing to pay for a stock right now. A standing offer to buy.
Ask: The lowest price a seller is willing to accept. A standing offer to sell.

The difference between the top bid and top ask is called the spread.

How It Connects to Trading
If you "buy at market": you get the best ask (you pay the lowest price someone is offering to sell).
If you "sell at market": you get the best bid (you get the highest price someone is willing to pay).
HFTs watch changes in bids/asks tick by tick to detect opportunity, liquidity, and imbalance in real time.


Liquidity Detection
Liquidity is how easily you can buy or sell without moving the price much.
HFT bots scan the bid/ask volume at the top price levels to decide if they can enter or exit without causing a price swing.
Example: If there are large bids, it’s easier to sell quickly; large asks mean easier to buy.


Price Prediction and Imbalance
If the order book suddenly fills with strong bids but few asks, it signals more buyers are aggressive—price may rise.
HFT strategies watch for “imbalances” to predict very short-term price moves:
They might place quick buy orders before prices move up.

Market Making
Some HFT bots provide liquidity: posting both bids and asks, capturing the spread when others trade against them.
Constantly updating their prices and volumes as the order book moves.

Arbitrage Bots
As discussed, HFTs check bids and asks across multiple exchanges to find risk-free profit (arbitrage).

Matching Engine – Deep Dive
The matching engine is the part of every exchange (like NSE/BSE) responsible for “matching” buy and sell orders so trades actually happen.
It takes all bids (buy orders) and asks (sell orders), arranges them by price & time, and matches them by rules:

It takes all bids (buy orders) and asks (sell orders), arranges them by price & time, and matches them by rules:
Price priority: Highest bid with lowest ask.
Time priority: If price matches, the oldest order goes first.


How does a matching engine work?

Incoming Order
A new order arrives: “Buy 100 shares of XYZ at ₹100.05.”

Book Comparison
The engine compares this order against existing sell orders (“asks”).
If the new buy price ≥ any existing sell price, it finds the lowest price seller.

Execution
If there is a match, trade occurs at the seller’s price.

Update Order Book
The matched orders’ quantities reduce accordingly.
If either order runs out of shares, it vanishes from the book.

Partial Fills
If you want to buy 200 shares, but only 150 are available at best ask, you get a “partial fill”; the rest waits for more sellers.

What is NIFTY? (In-Depth)

NIFTY (officially called the Nifty 50) is India’s major stock market index—like the “S&P 500” of India.
Tracks the 50 largest and most actively traded companies listed on the National Stock Exchange (NSE).
It covers many sectors: banking, IT, energy, FMCG, etc.
Acts as a benchmark: Investors and traders look at how the NIFTY is moving to judge the “mood” of the entire Indian stock market.

Why does NIFTY matter (even for HFT)?
Liquidity: Stocks in the NIFTY are heavily traded—meaning lots of opportunities for fast buying/selling and less risk of moving the price.
Derivatives: Many futures and options contracts in India are based on the NIFTY, making it central for hedging and speculating (a big focus of algorithmic trading).
Market Barometer: HFT strategies sometimes monitor NIFTY price-moves to drive trades in related stocks (index arbitrage, basket trading, etc).


NSE (National Stock Exchange)
NSE is India’s largest stock exchange by volume and technology.
It was established in 1992, based in Mumbai.
Known for fully electronic trading (no physical trading floor).

BSE (Bombay Stock Exchange)
BSE is Asia’s oldest exchange—founded in 1875.
Also based in Mumbai.
Became electronic in the 1990s as well.


Many companies are dual-listed—they trade simultaneously on both NSE and BSE.
Example: Reliance, TCS, Infosys, etc.
Prices are usually similar but can differ slightly due to micro-events and slight timing differences.

How is Arbitrage possible?
If one exchange’s price ticks up but the other hasn’t updated yet, a tiny arbitrage opportunity exists.
HFT bots can buy on NSE (if cheaper) and sell on BSE (if price is higher)—or vice versa.
This requires super-fast (millisecond) speed, network links, and robust code.

What is a “Fill” in the Market?
A fill means an order (buy or sell) has been successfully executed—someone agreed to take your price and quantity, and the trade is now “done.”
You have been “filled” on your order, either completely (full fill) or partially (partial fill)

Types of Fill:
Full fill: Your entire order is matched at your chosen price or better, in one go.
Partial fill: Only part of your order is matched (maybe there weren’t enough on the other side). The leftover waits in the order book.

HFT, C++ and Latency — Why Does It Matter?

Latency is the time delay between a market event happening (like a price change or order opportunity) and your trading system reacting to it (sending a buy/sell order).
In HFT, latency is usually measured in microseconds (μs, millionths of a second) or nanoseconds.

Why is Low Latency Critical for HFT?
HFT profits mostly come from being the first to spot and act on market opportunities (arbitrage, spread, market making).
If your system is even a microsecond slower than a competitor, you could miss trades, get “picked off”, or lose money.
Competing HFTs are all trying to shave every possible microsecond—faster networks, fiber optics, better code.


Why is C++ Preferred in HFT Environments?
C++ is chosen because:

It compiles directly to fast native machine code (no virtual machines or interpreters).
Gives fine-grained control over memory and CPU (no unpredictable pauses).
You can optimize for multi-core, parallelism, cache/thread locality.
Libraries for fast networking (e.g., handling sockets) and data processing are more efficient in C++ than in managed languages.
