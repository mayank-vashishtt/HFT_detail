sum problem in C++

struct in c++? 
what is struct?
class in java offers constructor, oops, private static -- access modifiers



one order struct have order id, bool -- its bid or ask, price , qty
2 object of orders createone object is of buy and one is of sell  -- istance buy and sell 
pass it to match function if buyer is able to match with seller 


order id 1  buy order 500price 10qty
order id 2 sell order 500price 5qty 
if i pass them to match function 
match of 5 qty
respons with another stuck -- qtyFit? -- int qtyfilled




deep copy vs shallow copy




deafult behaviour of c++ is to do deep copy 

int* ptr

int x --- 4 bytes -2^31 to 2^31
int is signed integer, 1 bit is reserved 
unsigned integer --- 0 to 2^31 
char -- 1 byte 



int -- > 4 bytes 32 bits 
uint -- > 4 bytes 32 bits 

int is not 4 bytes always 
why?

registor --> 
why 32 bit pc and 64 bit computer?
registor size is this 
registor is your CPU word size
you read something in RAM as batches of CPU word size 

long long ? 

int32_t y?
int64_t x?


unsigned char ?
The range of char in C++ depends on whether it is signed or unsigned:

Signed char: âˆ’128 to 127
Unsigned char: 0 to 255



pointers? -- USP of c++ 

kernel ?
raw memory location ? 
c++ have a feature to interact with raw memory 
that is with pointer 
pointer. --- it is a something that let you plays with raw meomory in RAM 

int x  = 22 ;
int32_t* x = x;

where we store address? 
address is hexdecimal, binary 
i should store address in Pointers

int* ptr = &x ;


*ptr?

why char* ptr give value. 


a -> isBid doing asterik a . for you 



tcp is suppodes to send stream of bytes 
who is receiving bytes have to frame 

wht UDP gives?  datagrams


unsinged char to 

what is buffer? .
 
 255 is 1111111111111111111111111 ? 

 notes from copiolot 

 the uint ? 


 binary to number ? 
 it reads it from back to front 


 big endian msb to lsb 
 lil endian lsb to msb 
 role of tcp ? headers in tcp ?
