Segments of the Financial Market

Financial markets are often divided into two main segments based on whether the 
securities are newly issued or already existing.

1. Primary Market
Definition:
The primary market is where securities (like shares or bonds) are created and sold 
for the first time. This is where companies, governments, or other 
organizations raise fresh capital.

Key Features:

Securities are issued directly by the company to investors.
Money from investors goes to the issuing company.
Often called the “new issue market”.
Regulated by authorities like SEBI in India.


Main Activities:
Initial Public Offering (IPO) → A private company sells shares to the public for the first time.
Follow-on Public Offering (FPO) → A listed company sells additional shares.
Private Placement → Selling securities directly to select investors.
Rights Issue → Offering additional shares to existing shareholders.

Example:
When Zomato launched its IPO in 2021, it sold new shares for the first time in 
the primary market, raising money for business growth.


2. Secondary Market
Definition:
The secondary market is where already-issued securities are bought and 
sold among investors. The issuing company does not receive any money from 
these transactions.

Key Features:
Involves trading of existing securities.
Takes place on platforms like stock exchanges (NSE, BSE in India; NYSE, NASDAQ in the US).
Provides liquidity — investors can sell their holdings at any time.
Prices fluctuate based on supply & demand, news, company performance, and market sentiment.

Example:
You buy 100 shares of Infosys from another investor on the NSE. 
This trade happens in the secondary market, and Infosys doesn’t get any money 
from your purchase.
