Segments of the Financial Market

Financial markets are often divided into two main segments based on whether the 
securities are newly issued or already existing.

1. Primary Market
Definition:
The primary market is where securities (like shares or bonds) are created and sold 
for the first time. This is where companies, governments, or other 
organizations raise fresh capital.

Key Features:

Securities are issued directly by the company to investors.
Money from investors goes to the issuing company.
Often called the ‚Äúnew issue market‚Äù.
Regulated by authorities like SEBI in India.


Main Activities:
Initial Public Offering (IPO) ‚Üí A private company sells shares to the public for the first time.
Follow-on Public Offering (FPO) ‚Üí A listed company sells additional shares.
Private Placement ‚Üí Selling securities directly to select investors.
Rights Issue ‚Üí Offering additional shares to existing shareholders.

Example:
When Zomato launched its IPO in 2021, it sold new shares for the first time in 
the primary market, raising money for business growth.


2. Secondary Market
Definition:
The secondary market is where already-issued securities are bought and 
sold among investors. The issuing company does not receive any money from 
these transactions.

Key Features:
Involves trading of existing securities.
Takes place on platforms like stock exchanges (NSE, BSE in India; NYSE, NASDAQ in the US).
Provides liquidity ‚Äî investors can sell their holdings at any time.
Prices fluctuate based on supply & demand, news, company performance, and market sentiment.

Example:
You buy 100 shares of Infosys from another investor on the NSE. 
This trade happens in the secondary market, and Infosys doesn‚Äôt get any money 
from your purchase.


---------------------------------------------------------------

1. Bonds ‚Äî Debt Securities
Definition: A bond is basically a loan that an investor gives to a 
company or government.

How it works:
You (the investor) buy a bond from a company or government.
They promise to pay you regular interest (called a coupon) and 
return the principal at the end of a fixed time (maturity).

Key Features:

Fixed maturity date (e.g., 5 years, 10 years).
Interest is usually fixed and paid periodically.
Lower risk than stocks (but returns are also lower).
Bondholders are creditors, not owners.
If a company goes bankrupt, bondholders get paid before shareholders.

Example: You buy a 5-year corporate bond at ‚Çπ1,000 face value with 7% interest ‚Äî 
you‚Äôll get ‚Çπ70 each year plus your ‚Çπ1,000 back after 5 years.



2. Stocks (Common Shares) ‚Äî Equity Securities
Definition: A stock represents ownership in a company.

How it works:

You buy shares of a company.
You now own a piece of that company ‚Äî if it grows, 
your shares can increase in value; if it pays dividends, 
you get a portion of the profits.

Key Features:

No maturity date ‚Äî you can hold the stock as long as you want.
Dividends are not guaranteed (depend on company profits).
Higher potential returns, but also higher risk.
Shareholders get voting rights in company decisions.
In bankruptcy, shareholders get paid last (after creditors and bondholders).

Example: You buy 100 shares of Infosys ‚Äî 
if Infosys profits, your share price may rise and you may receive dividends.



3. Preferred Stocks (Preference Shares) ‚Äî Hybrid Securities
Definition: A preferred stock is a special type of share that has 
features of both stocks and bonds.

How it works:

You buy preference shares from a company.
You receive fixed dividends (like interest on a bond), 
usually before common shareholders are paid.
You generally don‚Äôt have voting rights (unlike common shareholders).

Key Features:
Dividends are fixed and paid before common stockholders.
If the company is liquidated, preferred shareholders are paid after bondholders but before common shareholders.
Less risky than common stock, but usually less profitable in the long run.

Can be convertible (into common stock later) or redeemable (company can buy them back).

Example: You own preferred shares in a bank that pays you ‚Çπ8 per share annually, 
no matter if profits go up or down.




---------------------------------------

1. Share
Definition: A share is a unit of ownership in a company.

Companies divide their ownership into equal parts called shares.

If you own shares, you are called a shareholder.

Each share has a face value (nominal value) and can be bought or sold in the market.

üìå Example:
A company issues 1,000 shares in total. You buy 100 shares ‚Äî 
that means you own 100 individual units of that company‚Äôs equity.


2. Stake
Definition: A stake means your overall ownership percentage in a company, often expressed as a percentage of total shares.

It represents your interest or claim in the company, not just the number of shares.

The stake can be made up of:

Shares (common or preferred)

Other equity rights like options or convertible securities

üìå Example (continuing the above):
If you own 100 shares out of 1,000 total, your stake is 10%.
So:

Shares = the units (100)

Stake = the proportion of ownership (10%)
