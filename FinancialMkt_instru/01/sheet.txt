Financial markets are forums where suppliers and demanders of funds transact business. 
They are crucial for capital allocation in economies

It means that financial markets (like stock markets, bond markets, 
or currency markets) are placesâ€”physical or onlineâ€”where people 
who have extra money (suppliers of funds) and people or businesses
who need money (demanders of funds) meet to make deals.

They are crucial for capital allocation because they help direct 
money to where it can be used most productivelyâ€”for example:

Investors putting money into companies that want to grow.

Banks lending to businesses that need new equipment.

Governments selling bonds to fund public projects.

In short: financial markets are like matchmaking hubs for money, 
ensuring it flows from those who have it to those who can put it to work 
in the economy.

Types of Financial Markets
Financial markets can be divided into two broad categories 
based on the length of time for which funds are borrowed or invested.


A. Money Market
Purpose: For short-term borrowing and lending.

Maturity period: Less than one year.

Instruments traded: Treasury bills (T-bills), commercial paper, certificates of deposit (CDs), repurchase agreements (repos).

Participants: Banks, corporations, governments, and large investors.

Risk & Return: Generally low risk and low return, 
because the maturity is short and borrowers are usually very reliable.

ðŸ“Œ Example:
A company needs cash to pay salaries but expects customer payments next month. 
It can borrow in the money market for 30 days through commercial paper.



B. Capital Market
Purpose: For long-term borrowing and investment.

Maturity period: More than one year.

Instruments traded: Stocks (equity shares), corporate bonds, 
government bonds, debentures.

Participants: Individual investors, institutional investors 
(mutual funds, pension funds), companies, governments.

Risk & Return: Higher risk compared to the money market, 
but also higher potential returns.

ðŸ“Œ Example:
A company wants to build a new factory and needs â‚¹500 crore. 
It can raise this money by issuing shares or bonds in the capital market.




3. How Firms Raise Money in Capital Markets
When a firm needs funds, it has two main ways to raise them in the capital market:

1. Private Placement
Definition: Selling securities (shares or bonds) directly to a small group of investors, such as banks, insurance companies, pension funds, or wealthy individuals.

Features:

No public advertisement.
Faster and less expensive than a public issue.
Fewer regulatory requirements.
Investors are usually experienced and can invest large sums.
Example: A startup sells shares to a venture capital firm without listing on the stock exchange.



2. Initial Public Offering (IPO)
Definition: The first time a company sells its shares to the general public and lists them on a stock exchange.

Features:

Widely advertised and open to all investors.
Requires approval from market regulators (like SEBI in India).
Costly and time-consuming due to legal and marketing requirements.
Once listed, the companyâ€™s shares can be traded freely on the stock market.
Example: Zomatoâ€™s IPO in 2021, where anyone with a demat account could buy shares.



Yes â€” private placement and IPO are just two of the ways companies 
raise money in capital markets.
There are several other methods depending on whether 
they want equity funding (selling ownership) or debt funding (borrowing).

Other Ways Firms Raise Capital

1. Rights Issue
Definition: The company offers existing shareholders the right to 
buy additional shares at a discounted price before offering them to the public.

Purpose: To raise more equity without bringing in new owners first.

Example: Reliance Industries issues new shares to its current shareholders 
at a 10% discount.


2. Follow-on Public Offering (FPO)
Definition: After an IPO, a company can issue additional shares to the public.

Purpose: To raise more capital for expansion or debt repayment.

Example: A listed company needs funds for a new project, 
so it sells more shares in an FPO.

3. Corporate Bonds / Debentures
Definition: The company borrows money from investors and promises to 
pay interest periodically plus the principal amount at maturity.

Types:

Secured bonds (backed by company assets).
Unsecured debentures (backed only by the companyâ€™s creditworthiness).

Example: Tata Motors issues corporate bonds with a 7% annual interest rate.

4. Venture Capital & Private Equity
Venture Capital (VC): Funding from specialized firms or investors for 
early-stage startups.

Private Equity (PE): Funding from firms for more 
mature businesses (often for expansion, restructuring, or buyouts).

Example: Sequoia Capital invests â‚¹50 crore in a tech startup.



5. Crowdfunding
Definition: Raising small amounts of money from a large number of people, usually via online platforms.

Types:

Equity crowdfunding (investors get shares).

Debt crowdfunding (investors get repaid with interest).

Example: A small brewery raises â‚¹1 crore by selling shares via an 
equity crowdfunding website.


6. Loan Syndication
Definition: Multiple banks or financial institutions jointly lend money for a large project.

Purpose: Reduces risk for lenders since the loan is shared.

Example: An infrastructure company borrows â‚¹2,000 crore from a consortium of banks to build a highway.


7. Convertible Securities
Definition: Bonds or preferred shares that can be converted into common shares later.

Benefit: Investors get fixed returns initially and the option to convert into equity if the company grows.

Example: A company issues convertible bonds with a 5-year maturity.


ðŸ’¡ In short, the main categories are:

Equity funding â†’ IPO, FPO, rights issue, private placement, venture capital, crowdfunding.

Debt funding â†’ Corporate bonds, debentures, bank loans, loan syndication, convertible bonds.
