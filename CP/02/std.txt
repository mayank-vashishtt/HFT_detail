What is std in C++?

std is a namespace.
it stands for Standard — it contains all the identifiers 
(classes, functions, constants, etc.) from the C++ Standard Library.

Example: std::string, std::vector, std::cout all live inside the std namespace.

Think of std like a package name, e.g., java.util.


In Java you’d write:
java.util.ArrayList<String> list = new java.util.ArrayList<>();

in C++, you write:
std::vector<std::string> list;



2. What’s the :: syntax?


:: is the scope resolution operator.
It’s how you say: “Look inside this namespace/class for this name”.
std::cout means: go into the std namespace and get the cout object.
MyClass::myMethod() means: call myMethod defined in MyClass.

In Java:
You use . for both instance access and static access.

In C++:
. = member access on objects
-> = member access on pointers to objects
:: = access something in a namespace/class (like Java’s static access or package reference).


3.Why not just skip std:: every time?

You can, using:
using namespace std;
But in professional C++ you usually avoid it in headers and large codebases because:

Names in std might conflict with your names.
Explicit std:: makes it clear where things come from.


#include <iostream>   // like import in Java
#include <vector>     // vector is like ArrayList

int main() {
    std::vector<std::string> list; // std::vector is in namespace std
    list.push_back("hi");          // add to vector
    std::cout << list[0] << "\n";  // print
}



three C++ access operators with clear examples and Java comparisons so it sticks.


1. . — Member access on an object

#include <iostream>
#include <string>

struct Student {
    std::string name;
    void greet() {
        std::cout << "Hello, I am " << name << "\n";
    }
};

int main() {
    Student s;           // create an object
    s.name = "Alice";    // . to access data member
    s.greet();           // . to call method
}



2. -> — Member access on a pointer to an object

#include <iostream>
#include <string>

struct Student {
    std::string name;
    void greet() {
        std::cout << "Hello, I am " << name << "\n";
    }
};

int main() {
    Student s;             
    s.name = "Bob";

    Student* p = &s;      // pointer to Student
    p->name = "Charlie";  // -> to access via pointer
    p->greet();           // -> to call method via pointer
}

Equivalent in Java:

Student s = new Student();
Student p = s; // references are like pointers
p.name = "Charlie";
p.greet();     // in Java, still dot, because references auto-dereference



3. :: — Scope resolution (namespace/class/static access)



You’re seeing two different uses of :: (scope resolution) here:
Namespace access — School::hello()
Static member access — Student::count



Namespaces in C++ are like packages in Java — 
they group related code to avoid naming conflicts.


namespace School {
    void hello() {
        std::cout << "Hello from School namespace\n";
    }
}
School is a namespace.

Inside it, we have a function hello().

To call it, you must say School::hello(),
just like in Java you would say mypackage.MyClass.method().


📌Why :: here?

:: tells the compiler:
“Look inside School for something called hello.”



2. struct Student and static members

struct Student {
    static int count; // static member
};
struct in C++ is almost like a class, except members are public by default.
static int count; means:

This variable belongs to the class itself, not to any specific object.

In Java terms:
public static int count;
